# 🚲 Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis 📊

This project analyzes user data from Cyclistic, a bike-share company operating in Chicago. Cyclistic manages a fleet of 5,824 bicycles across 692 docking stations throughout the city, offering both casual (single-ride or full-day passes) and annual membership options.

## 🎯 Key Project Focus:

1. 📈 Analyze the usage patterns of casual riders vs. annual members 
2. 🔄 Identify potential strategies to convert casual riders to annual members
